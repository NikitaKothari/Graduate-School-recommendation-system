Description: This is an intelligent system which basically helps a student to check his eligibility

for a graduate school based on school’s admission criteria and other conditions like weather, cost

of attendance etc.

This application includes a web based GUI which accepts an input from user regarding his scores

in GRE, TOEFL scores, work experience, cost he can afford, semester he is applying and

subjects he has taken in undergraduate studies.

Based on the input provided by user, system will evaluate university wise rules from backend

rules and will provide a response whether user should apply for that graduate school or not.

Systems is completely configurable and can be used for multiple universities by adding rules for

new universities.
